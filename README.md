# Public-Health-Reporting-System

The Public Health Reporting System (PHRS) is an online reporting system that has been designed to assist the community with reporting health-related issues. The system allows for easy reporting via a report submission portal that will allow users to describe their health issues using words, pictures and location. Health authorities will have access to a dashboard that will allow them to see reports in real-time and can use those reports to maintain an up-to-date data inventory in order to properly categorize the reports and respond to them. The system will use data analytic tools that will allow health authorities to monitor trends, manage resources and implement preventive measures. The PHRS is developed to centralize and simplify reporting to ultimately help with managing and responding to issues that arise in public health.
